# Hulbert the Hedgehog

Hulbert is a happy little hedgehog that you can take care of. You have six choices: give food, a snack, a drink or milk, or pet Hulbert or play with them. Each choice either gives more or/and reduces points to Hulbert's hunger, thirst or social bar. Your job is to keep Hulbert happy by keeping the need bars full. Make sure not to let any of the bars drop to zero!

Happy playing!

## Setting up the game

1. Set up the code environment
Download Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download. Necessary VSC extensions should already be installed. Download our code from GitHub and open it in VSC (or open it via GitHub desktop and then in VSC).

2. Downloads in VSC
Type "npm install react-scripts --save" in VSC terminal. Type "npm install @mui/material --save" in VSC terminal.

3. Run the game
Type "npm start" to VSC terminal. It takes couple of seconds, but then a new localhost window appears in your browser. Then the game is ready to play! if you want to play the game again, refresh the window or type "npm start" again to VSC terminal.

4. Stop the game
Press "ctrl"+"c" in VSC terminal. Then type "y".

### Having problems?

1. You get error message in VSC
Follow VSC instructions. There might be extensions or programs to download that we had already and didn't take into account. In terminal, VSC also notifies if some react library that we used wasn't downloaded. In that case, type "npm install ____ --save" in VSC terminal and put the library's name in the blank spot.

2. "Something is already running on port 3000."
Type "y" to the terminal. 

3. You have different coding environment or older versions of the programs
Sorry, we have tested the app only with limited devices and versions. For example 1.74.3 version of VSC works.

4. Something else?
